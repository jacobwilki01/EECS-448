        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Jacob Wilkus, and am a computer sccience major here at KU. I am currently in my third semester of classes, and am taking AMS 100, EECS 210, and EECS 388 beyond this course.
            I am from Lawrence, Kansas, and am also a member of the KU Debate Team, where I serve as the team secretary. 
            In my free time, I enjoy to spend time outside and hanging out with friends. I also enjoy playing video games, and reading a good mystery novel.
        </p>
